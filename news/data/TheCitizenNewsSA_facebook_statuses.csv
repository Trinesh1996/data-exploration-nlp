1522943244635075_1620468984882500,"OPEN LETTER TO PRESIDENT JACOB ZUMA................06 September 2015.

Mr President...... this letter is not a attack on you as a person, but rather you as a leader of a nation that is crying for help. Sir, you as the Captain of the ship must be afraid...... as while it is sinking you would have to be the last one to leave, if you were a true leader !!!!

Your speech today to the SAPS in the presence of the Commisioner you want to suspend was nothing short of putting out lifeboats, and trusting there will be one left for you.

Sir,we have reached a stage of morale at its lowest in our land. The Public Service has reached an all time low due to your lack of leadership, nepotism, and hiring people that are not skilled for the position.

-You have appointed people to positions who have helped you sink the ship ,
 - You have put yourself above the constitution, of which many had sacrificed their lives for, and today are forgotten..............forgotten heroes of the soil that fought for freedom but only got a vote!.

-You are not a servant of the people, but a man who uses the constitution to stay out of court, disrespect the Public Protector, and other organs of state.
 -You are becoming the next Dictator of Africa.

-The blood of the people who died at Marikhana and that perish in violent crimes soaks your hands Sir.... you today spoke about the Police taking control, but how can they? as the ship is sinking....rudderless and with no leader at the helm..

Sir our nation has millions addicted, gangsters and drug dealers are our youngsters role models, and you have done nothing to empower your people. You opened the borders and people have come in search of milk and honey at the expense of those who were marginalized in the past.

Sir you are presiding over a nation in pain ,a broken nation ,an addicted nation ,a violent nation that borders on anarchy ...

You, Honourable President are the Captain without a compass, and every day we watch our children perish as they have no hope, dream or vision, as you have made what is wrong.....right [sic]

-You have reaped the rewards of the Presidency, but when History is written, you will go down as the Captain who abandoned his ship ,his people ,a nations pride .
 .
 Please do one right thing, and abort ship so that we as a nation can try save our people.... we beg you Sir -its the only legacy you will have. 

God Bless our beloved Land..

With tears in my eyes

Warm Regards

Once again the ANC have got their priorities all wrong - get rid of dual citizenship and see the job losses and the Rand at 20 to the dollar.

The ANC is so obsessed with Israel, the only true democracy in the middle east. but they refuse to do anything about the gross violations of human rights in Sudan.

Not only did they violate a court order issued by a full bench of the North Gauteng High court prohibiting al-Bashir from leaving the country but now President Zuma cozies up to him in China and is going on an official visit to Sudan later this year.

The lives of over 300 000 Black people who were murdered in Sudan means nothing to the ANC.

There is blood on their hands..............

1522943244635075_1620097128253019,"COSATU and TONY EHRENREICH where are you now?

I am waiting with bated breath to see what COSATU and it's regional secretary of the Western Cape Tony Ehrenreich who is also the ANC Leader in the Cape Town City Council are going to say and do after Bafana Bafana's latest 3 - 0 humiliation against Mauritania.

Imagine a team placed at position 72 in the FIFA ratings losing the team in position 113, what an embarrassment.

When the Springbok Rugby team lost to Argentina they attacked the coach and the player selection.

These are touted a lack of representivity as the reason why the Springboks have now dropped to 5th position in the world rankings.

Perhaps they should approach Comrade Fikile Mabula to implement a 40:60 quota in football games?

Once again their silence is deafening.

They do not even comment when SA drops to 72 in the world rankings and 17 in Africa. When Clive Barker was the coach we were 16 in the world rankings and won the African Cup of Nations. For some reason Clive Barker was fired by SAFA.

They never comment on the lack of representivity in the Bafana Bafana team. The team on Saturday did have a token white player who the SABC ensured was pictured in all their coverage of the team.

Neither COSATU nor Tony Ehrenreich have questioned the US$10 million donation (bribe?) to CONCACAF before the 2010 World Cup. After this result it is clear that the money should have been better used to upgrade facilities for poor people in South Africa.

The reason why neither COSATU nor Tony Ehrenreich are prepared to comment is because the SA Football Players Union is a member of COSATU who are inclined to favour Vavi and they do not want to antagonise them.

Also Comrade Tony could not attack Comrade Danny Jordaan the head of SAFA and the ANC mayor of the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality.

1522943244635075_1618665388396193,"Credit for this article goed to Heleen Hofmeyr - I haven’t voiced my opinions about Open Stellenbosch to date mostly, I think, because of all the friends I thought I’d lose if I aired how I really feel. Also because I take really long to form an opinion about something. But today is the day. Time to reveal what’s been building up inside me over the past few months. To the friends I’m going to lose by posting this, thanks for the great times together.
I’m deeply sorry it had to come to this. But here we are.

I was there today, supporting you guys. I heard your demands and I am completely in agreement with every single one of them.

But I left you outside Admin B this afternoon after a sequence of related events. First, one of you stood up there on the steps and shouted into a megaphone, “Good afternoon everyone! Thank you for interrupting whiteness today!”

That’s what I was doing? Who knew? I thought I was just marching against the language policy at Stellenbosch University in my lunch break but if we’re calling that ‘interrupting whiteness’ I guess I can go with it.

A few minutes later I asked my two black friends standing next to me to please translate the words of the song that was currently being sung by the crowd, as I had been doing for every song up until that point. A moment of silence. “Erm. This is kind-of awkward,” one of them said. They exchanged an uncomfortable glance.

“What? Why? I wanna know what they’re singing. Please tell me,” I insisted.

More silence and two-way glances which did not include me.

“This one’s on you, friend,” one said to the other.

Deep breath. “Okay. What this song means is that… Well, okay. Hmmm.” This was clearly hard for her. “The first word means ‘happiness’, and then it’s like… ‘when we hit the white man’. I’m sorry, Heleen. It’s not about you. It doesn’t mean… I’m sorry.”

Oh, okay.

That was almost breaking point for me. This was not what I signed up for. Obviously I’m ignorant about the role of struggle songs in fostering a national identity blah blah blah. And I’m not gonna go into that here. This debate has been had and I don’t even remember what we all decided as a politically correct nation regarding which words are appropriate to sing and which aren’t, so there really is no need to rehash it all. I just have one thing to say on this point, and seeing as though you are such fans of using personal emotions to get a point across, Open Stellenbosch, let me tell you how it makes me feel to stand in a crowd and hear that the people all around me want to physically injure me because of the colour of my skin: it feels like my close friend has just punched me in the stomach. It feels like I am in a sea of people to whom I could never in a million years relate. It feels like I am not welcome in Stellenbosch, in South Africa, in Africa.

I didn’t leave at that point because I felt too bad for my friend who had explained the words to the song to me. She was possibly even more uncomfortable than I was and it really wasn’t her fault they were singing this song. And it’s not like she was singing along or anything. So I stayed.

“This is a purely emotional response,” I told myself. “Don’t let it get to you. They don’t mean it like that.” I tried and tried to reason my way out of my anger and discomfort.
But then someone who had been standing in front of me all along turned his makeshift sign around. I had been trying to figure out what the sign said since we got there. “One sett” was all I would make out. What is that? One set of what? And then he turned it around. It turns out “one sett” had been the beginning of an attempt at a sign which had failed and had been started over on the reverse side of the poster. The second attempt was more successful. “One settler, one bullet.”

Oh.

“Well guys, that’s just about enough for me for today.”

How did that happen? How did we go from “All classes must be available in English” to “one settler, one bullet”? Can somebody please explain that to me? What on god’s earth do equal rights to university education have to do with murdering all white South Africans? I know, I know. I’m taking it too literally again, aren’t I? He didn’t mean that, did he? Well can somebody please explain to me what he did mean? Because I cannot for the life of me imagine what else “one settler, one bullet” means, other than Africa For Africans, Kill The Boer, etc, etc. And that, Open Stellenbosch, is where you lose me.

Make Stellenbosch’s language policy such that no student or staff member is in any way disadvantaged by a lack of profiency in Afrikaans? Yes, by all means. Transform an exclusive, traditional, white student culture at Stellenbosch? Yes, sir. Fight all forms of institutionalised racism and sexism on campus? By the power vested in me, yes, yes, yes!

But THIS? Singing violent, racist struggle songs? Waving around a slogan which reminds all South Africans (or at least those who paid attention in their history lessons) of a violent, racist movement that sought not the equality and freedom of all persons that you supposedly stand for, Open Stellenbosch, but a civil war between black and white? DIFFERENT THING, BRA.

By all means, if this is your agenda, go for gold. Seriously. Do your thing. Maybe South Africa needs a civil war. I don’t know. If that’s what you think is necessary, Open Stellenbosch, then give it all you’ve got.

But do us all a favour and just be honest about it. I’ve heard it said many times that Open Stellenbosch is so brave. I couldn’t disagree more. Bravery would be standing in front of a camera and saying, “White people don’t belong in South Africa.” What you’re doing is hiding your true agenda under the very politically correct blanket of Stellenbosch’s language policy, appealing to our whole nation’s very fine-tuned sense of fairness regarding equal rights to higher education to push an agenda that asks for much, much more than that.

If I’m right, and you’re hiding your true agenda on purpose, how’s about you think about maybe growing a pair?

If I’m wrong, and your demands really are limited to English being available as a language of instruction at Stellenbosch University, then maybe you should think about what it is about the way in which you’re tackling your language movement that makes people who think it’s okay to wave signs around that say “one settler, one bullet” join your cause.

One of you once told me your agenda is just so have all subjects offered in English at Stellenbosch.
“Wow,” I said. “I didn’t realise that was all you guys are pushing for.”

“Yeah, people are often surprised by how reasonable our demands are,” you said.

You might want to ask yourselves why that is, Open Stellenbosch.

And then you might want to think about whether it helps the cause that you so tirelessly fight for to come across as a racist, violent movement that wants to get back at whites for all the times your feelings got hurt by a white person in this country.

I’m gonna go with ‘no’, but hey, what do I know, right? I’m just a white girl who clearly doesn’t understand",,status,,2015-09-02 15:51:27,1,0,0

1522943244635075_1618600428402689,"Mr ‘Razzmatazz’ Fikile Mbalula out does himself again!

Our Minister of Sports Mr ‘Razzmatazz’ Fikile Mbalula has once again given us one of his pearls of wisdom.

Commenting on Durban been awarded the right to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games he commented that “Durban hosting the 2022 Commonwealth Games will reaffirm South Africa as a tourist destination.”

The question that has got to be asked how many of the will be able to obtain visas and will all those who require unabridged birth certificates be allowed to attend if they their countries to not issue them. Our sporting spectacular has the potential to a sorting disaster. The regulations will probably still be in the process of being reviewed because Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa (maybe President) will be cruising around in a Gupta Jet.

With the support of the voters maybe President Mmusi Maimane will be half way to achieving Vision 2029!

This was said on the same day as the Acting CEO of SAA stated to the portfolio committee in Parliament that part of the reason for their drop in revenue and likely loss this year were the unintended consequences of the new visa regulations. These regulations were introduced by Minister Mbalula’s colleague Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba

Government seems oblivious of or does not care about the situation. Just last week Speaker Ms Mbete responded to a request from James Vos MP for a debate of public importance on the impact that the newly promulgated visa regulations are having on our economy and jobs by stating that a debate in terms of Rule 103 should be of “sufficient immediate public importance to give it precedence over other programmed business”.

Obviously the Speaker believes job losses are not important. The impact of the new visa regulations on the economy in 2014 was a negative R2.6bn and a loss of more than 5 800 jobs according to an impact assessment report by Grant Thornton, commissioned by the Tourism Business Council of South Africa.

The report predicts that in 2015, the number of lost foreign tourists due to changes in the immigration regulations is likely to decrease to 100 000, with a loss of 9 300 jobs and a net loss to the South African GDP of around R4.1 billion. Job creation is also in danger... According to the Tourism and Business Council of South Africa, every sustained increase of 12 tourists to SA, creates one new job. Therefore the industry’s ability to create jobs is being severely undermined

1522943244635075_1617879985141400,"IS SHAUN ABRAHAMS HIS OWN MAN?

The first significant decision that Advocate Shaun Abrahams, the new head of the National Prosecuting Authority, made was a questionable one. He decided earlier this month that the NPA would not pursue charges of fraud and perjury against Ms Nomgcobo Jiba despite the overwhelming prima facie evidence against her.

Instead  he appointed her as the head of National Specialised Prosecution Services!
 
Despite all the evidence that constantly demonstras that she is Ms Jiba is unfit to serve in a top office of the NPA. Although the criminal charges have been withdrawn by Abrahams she is still facing actions see her disbarred by the South African Bar Council.
 
How can someone who the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) considered to be unfit for office and was found to be dishonest by the KwaZulu-Natal High Court. Furthermore, an Inquiry headed up by retired judge Zak Jacoob found Jiba’s conduct to be wholly unbecoming of a senior member of the NPA and who treated the Inquiry with disdain by refusing to cooperate with its directives.
 
Abrahams went to great length to emphasise that he personally did not review the case before dropping charges. He acted on a recommendation of Marshall Mokgatle the regional head of the specialiased crime investigation unit in Pretoria. A person of junior rank to Jiba.

One would certainly have thought that pending charges against a Deputy National Commissioner of public prosecutions would be investigated by someone of the same rank or the Director himself. After all he is accountable for the NPA – the buck stops with him.

Lets now see Richard Mduli walk free and if the 793 charges against Zuma are referred back for investigation will be withdrawn. Adv “I am my own man” has not instilled much trust with his first decision.

THE ECONOMY – QUO VADIS SOUTH AFRICA?

President Zuma’s dismal performance the National Assembly on Thursday 6 August where his answer too many questions was “I did not know” and final question that South Africa was getting along just fine and that ""this is a well-governed country” left many commentators bewildered about the counties future.

After Zuma insisting that SA was ""doing very well"" he had to call a special media conference on Tuesday 12 August to report progress since his February State of the Nation Address. At this media conference, he came close to admitting SA was in a crisis. However, he insisted the country was not alone in experiencing low growth, nor was the problem one of SA’s own making. President Jacob Zuma claimed that the state of the economy it’s not all “doom and gloom”.

The result was the rand falling to its softest rate of 12.93 to the US Dollar close to its all time low of 13.82 on 20 December 2001. On 24 August the Rand briefly reached a new low against the dollar of 14.06. The JSE All Share index dropped a massive 3.16% to reach a level of 47 631 on 24 August well below its all time high of 55 188 reached in April this year.

At the weekend the Rand/Dollar exchange rate and the JSE All Share Index have clawed back some of their losses and are at 12.82 and 49 967 respectively. Most economists do not believe that this will be a long term recovery. After reaching an all time low in December 2001 President Mbeki introduced the Growth, Economic and Redistribution (GEAR) programme and in 2009 when President Zuma assumed office the Rand/Dollar exchange rate was 7.76.

This week SA has seen the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) decrease by 1.3% in the second quarter of 2015 this suggests that there is now a real danger that the economy may slip into recession resulting in further job shedding.
 
The economic slowdown means that the projected economic growth will fall below the 2.0% projected by the National Treasury, well short of the 5.4% percent envisaged in the National Development Plan.
 
This will impact negatively on revenue collection. The South African Revenue Service (SARS) reported this week that revenue had fallen short by R2.94 billion, or 0.9% percent of the revenue collection target, in the first quarter of 2015. The economic downturn will lead to an ever-shrinking tax base reducing funds, hampering government’s policy of eliminating poverty.

The Financial Mail and other economists have long warning that the economy is in crisis. This crisis of confidence is caused by government’s mismanagement of the economy together with other global factors like China’s slowdown and the uncertainty of the US Federal Reserve’s stance on interest rates.

Because there are both negative domestic and external forces bearing down on the economy the predicament is much worse. Government’s proposals to turn the economy around treat the symptoms rather than the causes. They include:
• Embarking on a programme to build Nuclear power stations;
• Promoting greater beneficiation of raw materials;
• Choosing 100 potential new industrialists to promote expansion in the manufacturing sector;
• Expanding the drilling for oil project off the South African coastline and also fracking in the Karoo; 
While having benefits they are impractical, the beneficiation of raw materials and expanding the manufacturing sector require electricity now and not in 2030 when the nuclear power stations will be completed, Medupi Power Station is currently four to five years behind schedule. The nuclear programme costs remain prohibitive with estimates of over R1 trillion. The offshore drilling and the fracking proposals are badly timed. In July 2015, it was reported “a hush has fallen over SA’s oil and gas exploration as plummeting oil prices coincided with a lack of progress in creating attractive legislation for the oil and gas sector”.

A determined action plan to rectify the structural problems facing the South African economic slowdown and possible recession is required to lead to prevent further job shedding and increasing 7.6 million people looking for work in South Africa.

There are policy options available to tackle the fundamental roadblocks to economic growth; these include policy uncertainty, the energy crisis, inflexible labour laws and labour militancy, failing parastatals, visa problems and red tape in obtaining funding and state incentives. 

Steps that can be taken in the short term are to:
• Offer tax incentives to companies willing to invest in producing power for their own use and are able to sell their excess production to the national grid and expand the quantity and size of the IPP’s, independent power producers, to ensure that new sources of power resources are built quickly and on budget;
• Adopt and implement the long overdue bill which would remove the electricity transmission grid from Eskom and place it in a separate entity and privatise sections of Eskom through the sale of equity to the private sector, government can retain the majority shareholding;
• Revise the visa regulations to provide for the obtaining of biometric data on entry into the country;
• Create a “One stop shop” where prospective investors can obtain information, all the required documentation and permits to establish a new business in the country;
• Establishing Job Zones near ports and airports, and in rural areas, to attract investment into industries that employ many people;
• Introducing a real Youth Wage Subsidy to address high levels of youth unemployment. The current Employment Tax Incentive (ETI), has failed to provide young South Africans with job opportunities;
• Repeal and amend laws that reduce international and local investment through threats of nationalisation and limitations on foreign ownership;

Failure to take immediate action would result in a full blown recession reducing employment and decreasing the tax base. The country cannot sustain an economy where government wages are up 40% since the Great Financial Crash of 2008. Latest figures reveal that the number of South Africans who benefit from social grants has more than doubled from 12.7% to 30.2% over the past 10 years and the percentage of households in South Africa that received at least one grant increased from 30% in 2003 to 45.5%. Grants are an important safety net for persons living in poverty but the better solution is to create an environment where permanent jobs are created.

This cannot be sustained with the narrow South African tax base. Research shows that in South Africa only one in ten adults pay personal income tax to an amount worth mentioning this is also applicable to other forms of tax in the country. According to a quarterly Labour Market Report by Solidarity, compiled in collaboration with ETM Analytics, only 3.3 million out of a total 33 million eligible tax payers in the country pay 93% of all personal income tax. Worse still, only 3.7% – or 1.1 million people – pay just short of 70% of the total income tax received. Out of a population of 55 million people, of which about 30 million are of working age, a mere 1.1 million people pay 70% of all personal income tax.

Government seems oblivious of or does not care about the situation. Just this week Speaker Ms Mbete responded to a request from James Vos MP for a debate of public importance on the impact that the newly promulgated visa regulations are having on our economy and jobs by stating that a debate in terms of Rule 103 should be of “sufficient immediate public importance to give it precedence over other programmed business”.

Obviously the Speaker believes job losses are not important. The impact of the new visa regulations on the economy in 2014 was a negative R2.6bn and a loss of more than 5 800 jobs according to an impact assessment report by Grant Thornton, commissioned by the Tourism Business Council of South Africa.

The report predicts that in 2015, the number of lost foreign tourists due to changes in the immigration regulations is likely to decrease to 100 000, with a loss of 9 300 jobs and a net loss to the South African GDP of around R4.1 billion. Job creation is also in danger... According to the Tourism and Business Council of South Africa, every sustained increase of 12 tourists to SA, creates one new job. Therefore the industry’s ability to create jobs is being severely undermined.  

A grave concern is that government is not taking seriously is the decision by the US congress to launch an ""out-of-cycle"" review of South Africa’s trade practices and its commitment to market principles which could result in the country losing some, or all, of its benefits under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa). Last year alone AGOA was responsible for $1.7 billion in export revenue for South Africa.

The review will examine whether South Africa still qualifies for benefits under the US generalised system of preferences, eligibility for which is a precondition for enjoying Agoa preferences. This, according to the Federal Register notice, ""includes requirements that the country is making continual progress toward establishing, inter alia: a market-based economy; the rule of law, political pluralism, and the right to due process; the elimination of barriers to US trade and investment; economic policies to reduce poverty; a system to combat corruption and bribery; and the protection of internationally recognised worker rights.”In addition, the country may not engage in activities that undermine US national security, foreign policy interests or engage in gross violations of recognised human rights.""

It does not bode well that in recent years our government has flirted with policies that tamper with property-rights, intellectual property protection, and investor protection. Our handling of the Al-Bashir case does not reflect on our protection of human rights or our commitment to the rule of law. If we are excluded from AGOA, the ANC government will only have itself to blame.

It will not go unnoticed in Washington that President Jacob Zuma picked Rob Davies and Ebrahim Patel to run the economy. Both are members of the SACP. Mr Davies is a member of the central committee of the South African Communist Party, in whose name the African Communist recently published a ""political report"" declaring the Agoa eligibility conditions are an ""imperialist"" effort to impose ""neo-liberal policies"". Nor will the decision of a minister to revoke a mining licence at the drop of a hat be looked on kindly

The ANC and SACP do not realise the fact that our relations with China now mirror old colonial trade patterns. We ship raw materials to China and they export finished goods back to us, whereas the Americans import 60 000 cars made in SA a year. 

Government should not rely on our BRICKS partners to solve our economic woes China’s economy is grinding into a lower gear, growing at the slowest pace in nearly a quarter-century. Scandal-plagued Brazil stands on the edge of recession. A cliff dive for oil prices, sanctions, and the poor political choices of its leaders have Russia’s economy on track to contract 3.5% this year.

India is the jewel in the BRICS crown growing at over 7% since the election of Narenda Modi as Prime Minister. The government has now introduced a number of far reaching initiatives to grow the economy. Firstly it has set up a Bank Board Bureau to allow professional management to be appointed to run the heavily indebted state controlled banks as a board-managed company rather than being run by the government. That will address a lot of the issues facing the banking sector.

A national investment fund for infrastructure in India is being established. Government is going to allocate about $3 billion a year and also raise funds from the private sector, both domestically and globally, to invest in infrastructure. This should see significant money pouring into India’s economy. A third initiative is the auctioning of national resources in a transparent manner. Government has auctioned off coal resources and the telecom spectrum. That gives the government cash and will increase transparency for investment in those sectors. 
Following representation from NUMSA and ArcellorMittall (Indian owned) and Evraz Highveld (Russian owned) the government has this week imposed import levies on imported steel in order to save the South African steel industry and thousands of jobs. As most of our steel imports come from China our new ‘friend’ is not going to be happy.

If I was our government I would remember Bill Clinton’s election slogan in 1992 ""The economy, stupid""! They must forget old failed ideologies and concentrate on what is best for South Africa. Ironically the country, in which the financial crisis first emerged, the US, is in fact staging a powerful recovery. Its growth is up, unemployment is down, its currency is surging, and the US economy “creates broad spaces” for “innovation and enterprise”. An example we should follow.

Until next time,

Once again the Gupta’s are linked to the government in a shady business deal. This time Deputy President Ramaphosa has travelled on the personal Gupta Family private jet to Japan. It was hired from Execujet a company controlled by the Guptas with President Zuma’s son a company director.

This after all the controversy about the Gupta “wedding plane” landing at Waterkloof Air Force base and the President “knew nothing about it”.

There was also the reported case of the Gupta’s being involved in coal mines supplying coal to Eskom.

The DA and EFF are reported to have declared their intention to raise the matter in Parliament, I am willing to bet that they will get the same answer from the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, who refused to disclose details about the millions of Rands wasted on flights for President Jacob Zuma during the visit to Russia. This was:
 
“As previously indicated in response to repeated similar questions, the Ministry and the Department deems all information relating to the movement of the President and relevant operational planning requirements as security sensitive. This information will not be made public and will be submitted to Parliament through a parliamentary channel that protects such information.”

Another government cover up.

1522943244635075_1616449875284411,"An open letter to the MEC, COGTA MP 

(Dis)Hon MEC Mtsweni

It is with deep regret that in this democratic era, the people are being disregarded by their elected representatives to the extreme extent whereby they have to resort to platforms such as the media to relay their disappointment with the manner in which their legitimate grievances are being handled by their government.

This letter is primarily informed by the complete disregard displayed by your office in the handling of our legitimate demands as communicated to you by means of a memorandum of grievances on the 28th of April 2015.

In that memorandum we sought your intervention in ensuring that the people are duly afforded the basic services such as the allocation of stands, water and dignified sanitation as well as electricity. The people are in desperate need of these services as they are currently settled under appalling conditions with degrade their human dignity. If you did bother to read the memorandum and proceeded to act accordingly as you are supposed to have done, you will be aware that the people you are politically responsible to cater to remain in squalor to this very day! This is viewed by the people as facilitated dehumanization by government and will not be left unchecked as it is undesirable.

To further aggravate the insult on the people, the two officials from Gogta which were tasked with the responsibility to attend to the processes relating to the memorandum, viz  Mr. S.E. Nxumalo and Mr. Kunene both directors for Service Delivery Improvement  in your office, have proved themselves to be of dismal competence. This assertion is substantiated by the shocking treatment of the grievances of the people when they convened a meeting between representatives of the Dr. Pixley ka Isaka Seme Local Municipality and the Service Delivery Committee which represents the aggrieved community on  the 16th of July 2015. When arranging the meeting the officials informed the Service Delivery Committee that they have concluded all process relating to the memorandum and are ready to table the final report to the committee. Yet on the day no copy of the report was availed. In its stead, a verbal regurgitation of the municipality’s responses with seek to trivialize and discredit the people’s grievances was presented by the chief director, Mr. Kunene.
The people reject with utmost contempt this tomfoolery by Cogta and further demand that the copy of the complete official report as signed by yourself as the MEC be surrendered to the people with immediate effect. A further delay in availing the copy amounts to compounded injustice by the government.

In conclusion, please be advised that the people will not be disregarded to no avail. We therefore call upon you to discharge your responsibility of facilitating the delivery of the basic services as need by the people within a reasonable time period and further sanction the two official named in this letter for their unbecoming conduct in deceiving the people.

Kind regards

Of course that suited the ANC, surprising eighteen months later we are still to hear of the results of the investigation.

1522943244635075_1613318035597595,"Why was it necessary to publish an almost full page apology to President Zuma in The Citizen by Steven Motale for the second time? This same courtesy has not been extended to the many readers that disagree  with his opinion. In fact the only other comment published, on that page, in today’s Citizen is an opinion supporting Motale’s view and is written by Kay Sexwale an outspoken ANC supporter. 

Of course it is at the Editor’s discretion as to what he publishes or not, this hardly “being objective” as he implies that his predecessor was not. A case of the pot calling the kettle black?

This apology apart from being misleading is in certain aspects incorrect.

Motale certainly  has not taken the views of his readers into consideration when republishing this unwarranted “apology” on Friday 14 August 65% did not believe that an apology was warranted. 

In his apology Motale poses the question “Was Zuma actually found guilty of corruption?” No, he was not however, after publicly stating that he “wanted his day in court” he has in fact spent 6 years running away from the 783 counts of corruption, fraud and racketeering that are hanging over his head. In fact he has spent the six years planning and scheming on how to politically destroy any person or organ of state that tries to get him to court.

No matter how Motale may make light of Julius Malema court attendance he has gone to court and not tried to evade it at every turn. It was not his fault that the Judge threw out the case.

He bemoans that the media had found Zuma guilty of corruption while no court has made such a ruling. In order to justify his view he accuses Max du Preez of misquoting Judge Hillary Squires as saying Zuma and convicted fraudster Schabir Shaik had “a generally corrupt relationship”.
In actual fact du Preez never used the words “a generally corrupt relationship”. He actually wrote “a full bench of judges of the Supreme Court of Appeal had independently of an earlier judgment called Zuma and Shaik’s relationship a “sustained corrupt relationship” and “an overriding corrupt relationship””. The case was heard by Judge CT Howie in the case of Shaik vs The State (1) (2006) SCA 134.

Motale writes in his apology that “Unlike many among us, I have gone to the trouble of reading Squire’s judgment” it is a pity that he has also not “gone to the trouble of reading the Howie judgment”.

In his “apology” Motale implies that his predecessor was a DA deployee because he has since his retirement been elected a DA city councillor. Martin Williams very accurately responded to this and many other inaccuracies in the ‘apology’.

He does not seem to have a problem with two journalists attending an ANC function in their official capacity in January where the wore ANC colours. Vukani Mde and Karima Brown from the Independent Newspaper group are allowed to do that, image the outcry if a journalist arrived at a DA, IFP, UDM or EFF function wearing that Party’s regalia?

This is allegation most disingenuous he should know that the DA does not have the opportunity or ability to appoint staff at the Citizen – how about an apology to both the DA and your predecessor
Motale further alleges a case of corruption against the DA Mayor of Drakenstein to secure his farm. He read it in an unnamed  local newspaper. Because he did not read it in any national newspaper, including the one he edits, he claims “the story was killed”.

Once again he is disingenuous if there was any substance in the allegation many anti DA publications would have carried the item especially the Cape Times, New Age or is majesties voice the SABC. Probably some journalists of integrity investigated the matter and found it to be without substance.

As for his comment that people ‘pour scorn on the New Nation because it is pro-government” this too is incorrect they are scorned because of the large amount of taxpayers’ money is paid to them to host business breakfasts and for government advertisements when the have a minimal circulation compared to other newspapers, even the Citizen. Perhaps the Citizen has been promised an increased share of this income for publishing the apology to President Zuma!

What Motale fails to mention is that when Helen Zille  withdrew from a scheduled briefing at one of these breakfasts, The New Age published a report which cast her in an unfavourable light. A complaint to the Press Ombudsman by the Democratic Alliance resulted in a front page apology to Zille and the Democratic Alliance on 31 May 2013 ""for not asking them for comment on several important issues contained in two stories that we published earlier this year, and for headlines in one story that unjustifiably made her out to be a liar and a hypocrite"". Honest professional journalism?

Furthermore following another DA complaint to the Ombudsman on 3 February 2015  regarding a front-page article in The New Age that defended government’s disproportionate advertising expenditure in the paper. After missing a series of deadlines to respond to the DA’s complaint, the. The New Age wrote to the ombudsman on 25 February to ‘confirm the withdrawal of The New Age from the press ombudsman processes’.”
Considering the probability that the DA’s complaint would have been upheld it appears that, to avoid the embarrassment of apologising and retracting the story, The New Age decided to withdraw from the ombudsman process altogether.

It so sad to see that this is the type of journalism that Steven Motale admires.

After it’s jaded inception it would be sad to see The Citizen once again being government funded and an unapologetic government mouthpiece.

1522943244635075_1611713362424729,"An open letter to the Citizen Editor, Steve Motale

As an editor of a newspaper you are probably more educated than most of us but that definitely does not make you right. 

I don't know your motives for writing an article defending President Jacob Zuma and like many others will come up with a lot of possible reasons for you doing so. 

The most important fact you need to get straight of us never hated Zuma even if we disliked him for whatever reasons. While it is nice to have an educated president, people don't really care about his education, what they do care about is the type of person he appears to be. 

When anyone wants to be appointed in a position in which the public takes interest, that person must be prepared for being judged harshly by everyone. 

A public leader especially the president needs to be humble, truthful, kind, just, thrifty, wise, accountable, etc. 

Mr Editor, you touch on the rape case against Zuma, the Shaik-Zuma relationship and Nkandla. 

We all know that money and power can influence a judges decision and as for the relationship between Shaik and Zuma, only they and GOD knows. We have all seen injustice of the courts in sentencing Oscar Pistorius for 5 years imprisonment instead of a lifetime. After 10 months, he is being released next week. So you see, the guilty can get away in South Africa. 

Mr Editor, you and Zuma should not be arrogant and insult the poor by saying he should not pay back the money overspent on Nkandla because he didn't ask for it, nor can the defence that the closest Zuma has come to construction be valid because all he needs is common sense and fairness. 

Forget project managers, site managers and oversight bodies at Nkandla, it is Zuma's home, he should have overseen everything. If the common ""uneducated"" man or women can oversee renovations in their homes then surely Zuma should have than likewise.  

If Zuma could not be responsible for the ""upgrades"" on his home then how can he be responsible for the running of South Africa as president. 

Last but not least, the president, the ANC and every leader needs to stop blaming apartheid for their failures. I heard that Zuma blamed Apartheid for South Africa's economy. I'm no rocket scientist, but I remember the economy was better in the Apartheid years. Bread could be bought for under a rand and the price of everything was affordable. Shouldn't the economy be worse during sanction than in a free South Africa. By Zuma and top brass blaming apartheid, it could be understood that they are insulting the Blacks by suggesting whites are better than blacks in governing SA.

Stop blaming apartheid and start building a united nation free of corruption, crime, rape, abuse murder, and poverty",,status,,2015-08-14 04:59:58,1,0,0

1522943244635075_1611540875775311,"RE: APOLOGY FOR SINISTER AGENDA AGAINST THE STATE PRESIDENT

I read an opinion piece by Editor Steven Motale conveniently prefaced as an apology for being party to a sinister agenda against State President Zuma. There were telling flashes in the article that might betray his sincerity; not least a comparison with The New Age Newspaper. Without arrogating to myself superior intellectual prowess, that comparison is intellectually unfortunate since TNA is a Gupta business that has well known ties with the State President. But perhaps so by design to betray his own intellectual sincerity.

I took aim at several issues that I felt warranted intellectual interrogation.
First, “Sinister Agenda Against State President Zuma”. The piece failed dismally to substantiate both the composition and nature of the Sinister Agenda.

Second, that the Rape Charge was thrown at him. He admitted to have had sex that was prompted by her suggestive invitation. His judgment on the matter was enough to cast himself in negative and pathetic light. Let alone the age gap as much as the number of wives and concubines that he already had. For a journalist to use that argument reeks of cheap attempt at propositioning the powers that be for a plumb job like other journalists have done before him. Watch the space.

Third, Nkandla Matter and how much he could have known. Editor Steven unconsciously confirms that the renovations had never been necessary since he himself did not spend enough time there to notice the obscene extravagancy. 

Fourth, regards the Controversy over the Corrupt Relationship between the State President and Shabir Shaik, his former Financial Adviser, erroneously ascribed to a judicial pronouncement by Judge Squires on which bases former State President Thabo Mbeki relieved the then Deputy President of his job. That call is anybody’s to make. Lack of proof is legally sufficient to dismiss a case. It is disingenuous of anybody to claim, however, that lack of evidence is the same as or equal to proof of innocence. Those two issues are not the same. There is a legal concept call association. The late Jack Selebi was associated with Drug lords and everyone knows what such association amounted to. Neighbours come naturally, friends, you choose!

Fifth, the appointment of people who were believed to be deployees to do his bidding. Editor Steven’s argument here is so weak and intellectually deficient that he would be forgiven for selective amnesia. The appointments of Menzi Simelane and Helen Tshabalala have no justification expect for political patronage. The rest is an accident that failed to happen. The State President cannot escape that charge.

Sixth, the charge that the Media has an implicit agenda to oppose the State President, citing examples of Mr. Zwelinzima Vavi and Mr. Sello Malema. There are enough journalists at least Talk Radio Journalists who have long since ceased to take Mr. Vavi and Mr. Malema seriously since they turned coat. Editor Steven is guilty of the same charge of ignoring those voices and conveniently painting all media with the same brush.

Seventh, the crediting of the New Age Newspaper for journalistic objectivity [a relative term] and pro-Government stance to bring balance as well as the fact that the Sunday Times enjoy more advertising revenues from the State than the New Age. Assuming that we are intellectually sound, we all know the owners of the New Age and their close ties with the State President’s family and Cabinet. It is common knowledge that the newspaper does not enjoy a wide readership, that the State directly or indirectly maintains its lifeline. Who in his or her right mind would advertise in a newspaper that is known to lack significant readership? To their credit, TNA gets its geographical facts right instead of telling your readers that Polokwane is in the North West Province.

My reading of the piece is simple. I see someone desperate for an escape route, or in dire need of an exit strategy, who may be seeing his days at work as numbered. Someone desperately propositioning state machinery to hire him as a trick that many predominantly disadvantaged job seekers apply. Good luck!!!",,status,,2015-08-13 13:25:24,1,0,0

1522943244635075_1611116502484415,"I am sorry, President Zuma
by: Steven Motale, Editor of The Citizen

As a young journalist, I started my career at a community newspaper and later joined The Citizen believing that my stories would tell the truth and help to transform a historically troubled title with questionable politics into one more in tune with the spirit of a new South Africa. I eventually gave up on that and left it for another media group.

When I returned to The Citizen, perhaps some of those old noble ideas were still there - but the truth is that I imagined that being the first black editor of a newspaper initially dreamt up in the 1970s to be the praise singer of the National Party would be enough. But being black is not enough on its own. Being black doesn’t mean you are changing anything or making a positive difference. It just means that the pay cheque that would have gone to a historically advantaged person and his family is now going to a black one.

Being black and not being able to look past a reality carefully constructed by those who despise the true consciousness of blackness means you may as well be white. And it would be better if you were. Because at least that would be more honest. And more sane.

But this is not a message about race, although race always matters in this country.

It’s a message about how the media is as much to blame for the current parlous state of this country’s politics and economy as the politicians and economists who have brought us here.

It all started in 2005 when Judge Hilary Squires handed down judgment to the financial adviser, Schabir Shaik, of the then-deputy president of South Africa, Jacob Zuma.

Shaik was found guilty of corruption and fraud and sentenced to 15 years in jail. But Squires’ verdict had an unintended consequence: it allowed Thabo Mbeki to fire Zuma and cast him out into the political wilderness. At the time, everyone, myself included, thought that was finally the moment we had all been waiting for; the moment the ANC would start to clean up its own house. We thought, at last, that there would consequences in the ANC from now on for wrongdoing.

This, we thought, was the ANC we had always wanted, the one we always dearly hoped we’d get, because if even a deputy president was not safe from betraying the nation’s trust, then no one could be.

At last, we thought (or, at least, I thought) we were getting tough on corruption.

But there’s the rub, right?

Pause for a moment and consider: What actually happened in 2005? Let’s look back, past the million headlines that have been published since then, and paint the picture once more.

Was Zuma actually found guilty of corruption? And, should he have been fired in the first place?

If you read the papers or listened to those who did, you might have been inclined to think he was, because the judge, we were repeatedly told, found there was a “generally corrupt relationship” between Shaik and Zuma. But by now we should know better. Nowhere did he actually say that. The prosecution had said it at the time, all the time, but the judge never did.

More than a year later, the white-haired judge felt it necessary to point out that he had made no ruling on Zuma’s corruption or lack of it, and Zuma had not been on trial. Even the rape charge that was thrown at him around the same time (just to make sure of his demise, perhaps) proved to be an empty attempt to smear him.

Unlike many among us, I have actually gone to the trouble of reading Judge Squires’ judgment, and not only does he not make any pronouncement on Zuma’s guilt or innocence, he at times goes to great pains to point out that there was no evidence offered to him that Zuma acted improperly in reciprocation of Shaik’s many attempts to corrupt him. Zuma, it appears, may even have sent his lawyer to Paris to find out if Shaik had been using his name improperly.

You’d think that a judge taking the time to clarify his own ruling would be enough, but it wasn’t. Barely anyone even bothers to remember that he did that. And by the time the judge said it, the damage was already done. Zuma had been fired, setting in play all the elements for his machine gun dance to the Union Buildings.

The seeds of so much of what is wrong with this country today were sown there, in 2005.

I’ll spell out my point: Zuma was fired for a case in which he was not found guilty and his guilt was not even relevant. You may find that hard to believe, but go and read the ruling yourself.

Once Squires clarified his judgment, Cosatu demanded that Zuma be reinstated. But they were ignored, much like Mbeki had always ignored them.

If you’ve missed the irony, it’s this: we live daily in a country in which civil servants are suspected of massive corruption, much of which could be proven if subjected to the scrutiny of the courts. Most of the time, that never happens. This was the case long before Zuma became president, and was possibly at its worst under Mbeki. And yet Zuma was fired, in effect prevented from a near-certain rise to the presidency, on the basis of the flimsiest of pretexts.

It’s understandable that people might have been horrified at the thought of Zuma becoming the president. I certainly was. I was programmed to believe that a president, at the very least, should have gone to school. I’d forgotten that Abraham Lincoln never went to school and that Adolf Hitler did go to school. Also, the idea of someone with multiple wives running the country filled me with distaste, too, because, I must have been telling myself, I was not that kind of black.

But the truth is that I gloried in reporting on Zuma’s downfall with all the same glee as everyone else in the media at the time. We simply didn’t like him. He simply wasn’t good enough. We’d decided that Zuma would be no good and do no good, and so we read what we wanted in Judge Squires’ ruling, and ignored the old man when he tried to tell us we’d got it wrong.

In many ways the president has turned out to be quite measured, reserved and tolerant of us. Better than we may have expected him to be, and more forgiving than I would probably have been in the same position.

How, as the media, can we expect to be able to look at Zuma in the eye today and expect him to trust us, and live up to any kind of expectation for good, when all we’ve ever prophesied was inevitable doom?

What could he possibly do that would satisfy us? And should he be acting and working for our approval in any case after we failed to tell the truth about his story more than ten years ago, and are determined to keep telling it the way it suits us – a way that is simply not the truth? Even the once-celebrated Max du Preez found himself so deeply married to the myth of the “generally corrupt relationship” that he left the Independent Group in a blaze of righteous indignation this year when his employers attempted to apologise on his behalf for repeating the lie in a column.

The facts about what really happened in 2005 should be in the public domain by now, and commonly known. But even the Wikipedia entry has it wrong.

Has anything about the way we’ve reported on Jacob Zuma and anyone allied to him in the ANC improved since 2005?

You only need to scan the recent headlines to see that it hasn’t.

There is no doubt the upgrades to Zuma’s private home in Nkandla saw unacceptably obscene amounts of public money being spent on the project – that is no longer in dispute. But who can honestly say they know for a fact that Zuma knew what Public Works was doing and how it was dealing with the matter? Did he tell anyone what to charge and how much to pay? We don’t know, but most of us assume he did. It’s unprofessional reporting that would not stand up in a courtroom.

The closest Zuma has come to construction was when he was breaking rocks on Robben Island, but now we pretend there weren’t project managers, site managers and oversight bodies at Nkandla. We choose to look at it as if there’s no possible way he isn’t guilty.

Maybe that’s right. But we don’t know.

We’ve done that before – and been wrong.

The hatred towards Zuma means that little he does or says is ever reported on positively. He can give a speech for two hours, but the only thing anyone is likely to read about what he said was something “controversial”. If someone is determined to paint you in the worst light possible all the time, what chance do you have?

How can we expect Zuma to rely on us, the media, when we have never rectified the basic facts of his constitutionally presumed innocence from 2005 onwards?

One can only speculate on the kind of president Zuma may have been had he not had to combat not only the infighting and divisions in the ANC (most notably the faction that ensured he was fired in the first place), but the media’s vilification of him too. It’s likely history will not treat his presidential terms kindly, because accountability for wrongdoing remains largely absent from his administration. If we’ve ended up with the worst possible Zuma, then we need to understand our role in that – but I’m also able to say that had I been fired for something I had not been found guilty of, I would have been far worse than Zuma is today. I would have had a real axe to grind. I would have had my revenge.

Zuma has allowed Mbeki his place in the sun, and hasn’t pursued him ruthlessly for the truth of what really went down in the Arms Deal. Today, Mbeki can make his snide comments about how the country is being run, and Zuma lets him be. The same can be said of many others. The same chief justice that many of us in the media claimed Zuma had appointed to be his lapdog is the same chief justice who took him on in public about the executive encroaching unacceptably on the judiciary. The same public protector whose report has been such a headache for him is the same one Zuma appointed.

He’s not a perfect president, and could be far better, but never is he given a shred of credit.

If anyone doubts that the media has an implicit agenda to oppose Zuma, have a look at how it treats and portrays anyone who is pro-Zuma, and then examine its same treatment and portrayal of those who want to dig Zuma’s grave. There can be no better example than Julius Malema, who has been both of those people over the past eight years.

When Malema was the man willing to kill for Zuma, the media portrayed him as a fool, a dangerous warmonger whose poor school results needed to be dug up and mocked. Every shred of evidence of corruption was dug up about Malema and global media awards were handed out for that work.

Now that he has become Zuma’s number one enemy, he has fans aplenty in the media. He’s commonly written about with the complimentary adjectives “effervescent”, “canny”, “strategic”, “relentless,” “popular”, “uncompromising”, “charismatic”, “fearless”, even “principled”. On Twitter, one can see an influential editor agreeing that he and the EFF are a “necessary irritation”. Now, stories about Malema’s allegedly ongoing corruption appear one day, only to disappear the next.

Why?

Because Zuma must get what’s coming to him, regardless of where it’s coming from.

Zwelinzima Vavi was the same. He was attacked when he called Zuma an “unstoppable tsunami” and was 100% behind Zuma. The media hated him then. Now that he’s part of those calling for regime change, he’s a media darling, a hero, despite being caught with his pants down after promising a junior worker a better job and life, only to induce her to have sex with him on his table, literally offering us a metaphor for how he screws the poor.

Last week, when Malema played his game of bluff to call for his day in court, he seemed to fool many a journalist, who compared him unfavourably with Zuma, who was “ducking and diving” from his day in court.

With the past that Zuma has had, I actually don’t blame him for expending so much time, energy and our shared national resources to stay out of court. He still has powerful enemies, and South Africa was told in 2008 by yet another judge, Chris Nicholson, that the corruption charges brought against him were politically motivated. He threw out that case, once again sending the media into despair. Zuma still has many powerful enemies, and those enemies still have access to the levers of control in the media.

After years, the DA finally got their hands on the so-called spy tapes last year, and we’re still waiting to hear if there’s anything there to justify the millions spent on getting their hands on it. After recent history, I wouldn’t be willing to bet that there’s enough there to justify charging Zuma with anything again. But fortunately I’m not a prosecutor or a judge, simply a humble newspaperman who’s grudgingly come to wonder how fair we have been to this one man, who has survived the worst that’s been thrown at him, and will probably survive far more.

In 2009 Zuma accepted ""very substantial damages"" from Britain's Guardian newspaper over an article that suggested he was a rapist and guilty of corruption and bribery arising out of his involvement in the $5 billion arms deal. If the Guardian couldn’t get away with saying it, what makes us think we can? We don’t lose any opportunity to remind people that Zuma stood accused of rape and we still portray Kwezi as a victim despite her credibility being completely discredited in court.

The media has long played the role of unelected opposition to government in South Africa, taking its constitutional duty of being a watchdog to levels beyond what the fourth estate is meant. One hears numerous justifications from editors and journalists for why they give the DA a soft ride and focus all their efforts on discrediting the ANC, but if that’s what we’re about, then we should admit upfront that we’re DA newsletters. Then people would know.

If we’re as unbiased, fair and objective as we claim to be, then why is any wrongdoing in the DA barely ever mentioned in the press? It’s because the “educated classes” who work in the media want regime change “for the sake of democracy”. But the DA is also a ruling party, in the Western Cape, and scandals about its running of that province are like hen’s teeth. Admittedly, the DA has a lot to prove and so is going to run a tight ship, but it can’t be perfect.

Not very long ago, I was travelling in Paarl and came across a story in a local newspaper that the DA mayor of Drakenstein, Gesie van Deventer, had used a large sum of municipal money to secure her private farm. Locally, there was something of an outcry about this, but I did not pay too much attention to the details at the time, because I thought I’d read more about it in the national press. I never did. The story was killed long before it could reach that point. Now, I don’t know if the story is true, but when I read it, it seemed like it could be a mini-Nkandla. But no one was interested and the story went nowhere. If such a story were portrayed properly, people might feel indignant about it. But the media is the gatekeeper, and perhaps it decided that the world isn’t ready to hear about anything unflattering to the DA.

Even my own paper, The Citizen, was for years edited and led by a man who promptly joined the DA and became a councillor after his retirement from years of “objective” reporting of the news. This was perhaps a classic example of cadre deployment by a party that has viciously condemned the ruling party for the same policy. Martin Williams will probably find himself moving higher up the ranks in that party in the years to come. There’s nothing wrong with that, and he certainly has every right to express himself politically as a free citizen (pardon the pun), but had an editor in his position joined the ANC so soon after editing a national newspaper, you can only imagine the level of scorn he may have been subjected to by his former peers in the industry and the rest of our newspaper-reading public.

The reason most of our newspaper-reading public appears to be anti-ANC is because most of our newspapers are written for those who happen to be anti-ANC. Many of us in the media bemoan the fact that South Africa appears to be filled with unsophisticated masses who don’t know what’s being written about daily in the papers. But congratulations are in order for the man on the street – for the ANC’s rank file – who has consistently supported Zuma despite the sustained barrage of propaganda against him. The man on the street pays little heed to an agenda that seems to be all about regime change.

A man like Williams faces little condemnation despite the fact that the paper he ran like an extension of his own soul was so clearly pro-DA and he put any doubts about that beyond question when he was handsomely rewarded with a position by the DA. I would like to know why no other newspaper reported on the fact that someone who had been the editor-at-large of The Citizen was suddenly a DA councilor a few weeks after resigning from his prominent position in the media.

At The Citizen, I made it a point, in the interests of transparency, to publicise his political career move, but no one else considered it a story.

Williams does not have his position today in the DA based on merit – he was never a politician in his life. It’s a reward for his years of loyal service to the DA. I was reporter, and later political editor, of The Citizen while he was editor, and every DA press release was published in the paper on a daily basis. But a paper such as The New Age that has made it clear from the outset that it exists to portray the positive aspects of government, in order to provide balance to the media spectrum, has been vilified, ridiculed, dismissed and labelled untrustworthy before even a single one of its articles are read. Simply by being “pro-government” it is tagged as “untrustworthy” by the rest of the industry.

But at least it is being honest. You can pick it up and know how to read it and understand it. What it publishes is subject to the same Press Code as the rest of the industry, and it can’t get away with simply publishing falsehoods. When the rest of us say we shouldn’t be judged under a blanket umbrella of distrust by government and that government should rely on the media to self-govern and be governed by the Press Code, surely we should extend the same principle to The New Age? But do we? Is The New Age judged by its content and each of the individual articles it runs? And where does that leave our argument about our own ability to regulate ourselves, our own bias and ability to portray an accurate picture of the general reality of life in South Africa?

We pour scorn on The New Age for running so much government advertising, but show me a newspaper that doesn’t run state advertising, and doesn’t rely on it to survive. The biggest recipient of state advertising has been the Sunday Times, not The New Age.

It’s not just government that’s still new to getting democracy right. The media is, too. And the bottom line is: we should be willing to try harder to be better at this thing called democracy, and one can only hope that, in return, somehow, our government will be too.

I’ve been party to the sinister agenda against Zuma, and can only apologise for that. I’m not saying I’m suddenly his biggest fan, but it’s time to admit I’ve been party to the unfairness, along with many of my colleagues.

Perhaps all of us should admit the same and try to move on after excising the festering tumour that we’ve been nursing like a vital organ. But it’s not. It’s dangerous, and needs to go.",,status,,2015-08-12 02:35:07,7,6,15

Non-surgical abortions work by taking medications, rather than undergoing surgery and they are more less effective than surgical abortions . Nevertheless, the advantages of non-surgical abortion procedures are that they avoid the need for surgery, avoid the risks of surgery and anesthesia, and are therefore considered to be ""safer"" than surgical abortions. Additionally, they are also considered to be more ""natural"" by some women. Instead of having a doctor perform an abortion upon her, the woman simply swallows some medication. These medications stop the pregnancy and induce bleeding.",,status,,2015-07-28 17:35:16,0,0,0

How Does it works
Step One: it blocks the hormone progesterone. Without progesterone the lining of the uterus breaks down ending the pregnancy.
Step Two: Misoprostol makes the uterus contract and empty causing a miscarriage
How long does it take?
Some women (2-5%) may begin to bleed after using the it in the office. Even so you must use Misoprostol as instructed. Most women will bleed and pass the pregnancy within several hours of inserting the Misoprostol at home.
How effective is it?
clinicsBoth abortion pills, mifepristone and misoprostol, are usually used in order to terminate a pregnancy. Mifepristone causes the embryo to detach from the uterus thereby cutting off essential nutrients and oxygen carried by the blood. Misoprostol is then taken two days later and triggers the evacuation of the embryo remnants through the vagina. This often appears as a heavyperiod.It is advisable that you consult with your medical practitioner for a further understanding of how the abortion pill works. All clinics offers Medical Abortion is approximately 95% effective. Misoprostol will cause serious birth defects to this pregnancy (s). Call. 0127702299.

. Have you been in a relationship with your partner for a long time and there is a failure to commit to marriage?

I may also help you save your marriage if it is in doldrums and you feel like it's going to the dogs. If separation or divorce is not what you wish for then let me help you. Ask yourself the following questions. *
. Your mate is not the caring, loving person you once knew in the beginning of this relationship.

Monica Jansen van Rensburg met 'n foto van haar seun op haar selfoon voordat hy verlede jaar Junie wreedaardig in Burgershoop vermoor is.
‘n Jaar nadat ‘n 18-jarige man se lyk in raaiselagtige omstandighede in ‘n sloot agter ‘n bekende nagklub in Burgershoop gevind is, is die skuldiges steeds nie vasgetrek nie.

Monica Jansen van Rensburg, die ma van Thinus Coetzee wat op 1 Junie verlede jaar erg aangerand is, het gesê sy het al op verskeie geleenthede die Krugersdorp polisie se speurtak oor moontlike verdagtes ingelig en is nou ongelukkig omdat daar geen vordering in die saak gemaak word nie.

Volgens haar het bewysstukke soos ‘n 32Gigagreep geheuekaart waarop belangrike stemboodskappe op gestoor is ook voete gekry.

1522943244635075_1597899103806155,"OPEN LETTER TO PIE NTAVYOHANYAMA
Pie,
The chickens have indeed come  to roost ; if not to toot  loudly , in  a more than ” justice coming down like mighty waters “  crackling scenario, that  I would have not  normally expected ,upon your person, as a  one time  despots’  quasi immunity beneficiary .
How you    became fugitive -Pie Ntavyohanyuma -  now  holed up in Belgium ,in fear of Piere Nkuruziza your  master of many years ,  beats me. 
If  you now  find yourself suddenly  truer to the tenets of democracy and sanctity of human life,  while sitting  almost uneasily on a couch in your nest of refuge in Belgium; do me a favour and think back on the afternoon of  the 21st April,2005.
 When you had  lent your person to the final  act of the execution of  Ambassador Bavumile.H.Vilakazi  then  High Commissioner to Uganda representing  South Africa ,to complete a well planned assassination of your victim ,whose victimhood  roots of the  plot to eliminate him, you might not even have understood .
 As they had then  stretched ,far deeper than his representativeness  of a government that very badly, needed to dissuade Nkuruziza from  doing exactly what he is doing now ; for his political party to be granted more hegemonic clout than all the rest in Burundi, with a  forcefully abetment  of  Yuveri  Museveni of Uganda and as a result Bavumile’s  government not abusing him only fully, but throwing him  like a sacrificial piece of meat   into the deep  of your masters snarling hunger for total  feudalist and  hegemonic power in the Great Lakes.
While Bavumile’s assassination has been denuded to have included  ritual murder  to clearly  benefit the Ugandans, with its then minister of health leading the pack,  fully indulging in  the   further dismemberment and harvesting  of his  remains’ orgy.
Only an international commission of inquiry will one day reveal as to how much the likes of you, Nkuruziza, Mbeki and Zuma stood to gain from his stolen body parts. Unless you beat your masters to it, by summoning  some guts and revealing all..
 By the way, Pie ,you have been openly indicted by a Mr Jan Tobias Vermaak a the manager in Bavumile’s office in Kampala , as the henchman that finished off my brother-he spelled out a very graphic way in which you induced the final heart seizure of  the  already badly physically battered heart of my brother -not only that -but how  Vermaak was  personally was armed with the knowledge of the state of his heart, and voluntarily  implicating himself extensively in the plot , as he nevertheless  paradoxically relates  Bavumile’s  last minutes in your hands Pie- very tearfully, whenever he has had an opportunity to relate it ... 
There was a bigger plot but you pulled the trigger Pie. You did it clearly, what ever the  other source  of   a sub-plot , directly under the instruction of Nkuruziza  entailed .
On the following day,  the 22nd April,2005,you and many principals out of Africa celebrated the signing of some pseudo Peace Agreement  dripping deep in my brother’s blood, but not even the least Zuma, did  even  in a whisper  acknowledge my brother’s death that occurred the previous afternoon , at your hands ; to the delegation of excellencies assembling at Entebbe .
Not one media in your country Burundi  mentioned the tragic passing of my brother ,on the following day  and subsequent days ,weeks and months ,as your assassinations  hands would have been  exposed.
Now as you shed off yourself , the apron strings of Nkuruziza and the Lordship of Museveni, is it  not time to come clean to  the world, as to  why my brother was killed and how the Peace Summit of the 22nd April 2005, was Africa’s greatest fuss and a Zuma/South Africa “Victory Lie’’ of all time ,now once more exposed by  the real  McCoy Nkuruziza true to form ,shedding more blood for more power...
Your great moment of grace is facing you in the  eye, seize it and tell the truth about the Nkuruziza, Museveni, Mbeki and Zuma  plot over my brother’s assassination now that you are  well protected from them .
I don’t have the luxury of being  ensconced  in some  Belgian  safe- house, I remain forever exposed to harm and even assassination ; but you don’t now , -you can come clean ...
You are now, no more not  protected and tainted by  the so called  diplomatic   immunities ditched out by despotic  butchers of  Africans by unqualified  visionless  African  wannabe rulers ,dripping with rivers of our blood...
Should by any chance ,my well sourced  allegations ,  having been kept from you , you now can read all about your indictment in my brother’s death in the book published online by Amazon, entitled : ‘YERSTERDAY IS NOT GONE... by Paul Njabulo  Villakazi
Go ahead   make a clean breast of it all, unless you are just a died in the wool , mean spirited  agent,  being paid by other forces going this time  around  against Nkuruziza . 
Being no clean refugee  but just another African scum . Come un,  do the best ever ; for  history the  African continent’s future   and yourself. 
I  will appreciate any feed back on my email address: oupaswazi@yahoo.com or my facebook account :Paul Njabulo Vilakazi
I thank you

1522943244635075_1593719114224154,"BIG BUSINESS CAN'T BE ENRICHED AT MY EXPENSE!

Today under the spotlight is Finrite volume insurance administrator which handles cell-phone insurance for Hollard Insurance. 

i bought Samsung galaxy S4 in 2014 and took out insurance on  it for R130 per month as premiums. A year and four months later i realized that they're they're debiting two premiums from my bank account.

i immediately alerted them and requested a refund, which they indicated that they'll investigate and i should expect the refund in the bank within seven days. This did not happen.

I've called Finrite offices on numerous occasions, only to be subjected to a machines wasting my airtime, and incompetent consultants that could not assist me appropriately. I've complained to hollard consultants at Game stores and  also called Hollard Insurance both keep referring me to Finrite instead of helping to get the matter resolved.  

It's now five weeks and still have not received that important SMS from the bank and want to take Hollard Insurance and Finrite on.

I've seems cancelled my insurance without a sore heart, and now in the market to get another insurance. Any recommendations? 

WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO PAY BACK THE MONEY? 
PAY BACK THE MONEY!! PAY BACK THE MONEY!!

ADVICE TO HOLLARD INSURANCE: PLEASE RECONSIDER FINRITE AND CHECK THAT THEY'RE REPRESENTING YOU WELL, YOU LOST A CLIENT DUE TO POOR SERVICE AND DON'T TAKE THIS LIGTHLY.

Please like and share

1. IF a company has unlawfully been stealing your money through unauthorized debits
2. IF you believe that the impersonal machines that answer phones at these big companies waste our your airtime.

WE MUST SPEAK OUT OR BIG BUSINESS WILL KEEP TREATING THE PUBLIC WITH CONTEMPT!!!",,status,,2015-06-18 22:45:27,0,0,0

1522943244635075_1588380824757983,"This is taken from a group called MOZ Forum.
The interdict document can be found there.

I have received many PM's asking me to translate the article about Facebook slander in today's edition of the Afrikaans newspaper ""Beeld.""

For those that are unable to understand the article from the Afrikaans newspaper I have tried to translate it Via Google Translate, here are the results:

A Welkom businessman with interests in Mozambique has received a preliminary injunction from the Free State High Court to prohibit any information about him and his immediate family being placed on Facebook or other social media place.

Carlos Carvalho of Maputo was also ordered by the order to immediately remove all information about Kobus Claassen and his family from his Facebook group and other social media.

Claassen sought this order after defamatory allegations were made by Carvalho on Facebook.

The order will be personally served on Carvalho, who has dual Mozambican and South African citizenship, it will also be sent to him by e-mail and It will also be placed on a Facebok group.

He has 30 days to oppose the preliminary injunction.

Claassen said in a statement before Acting Judge NM Mbhele he and Carvalho are both in tourism in Mozambique and are also both regular users of Facebook and involved in Facebook groups.

He said he was a regular visitor to Mozambique and his son, Jacques, a 80% stake in a company that owns a guesthouse there.

Claassen says he himself has invested money in the company to buy property.

On 23 September last year and regularly thereafter Carvalho on the Facebook page Moz I remarks on especially South Africans that put to him questions on the group

According to Carvalho wanted these people to let water their boats in Matolorivier the payment of port inspections and other fees to escape.

Claassen said following Carvalho's persistent remarks about South African tourists he answered him on 24 October.

Carvalho apparently disliked it, and went out of his way to set him in a bad light, said Claassen.

They attacked each other over and over again on Facebook.

Claassen said he said nothing derogatory about Carvalho.

What Carvalho said, comes down to him saying that Claassen has a bad character, cheat, breaking the law and stupid.

Eventually through the mediation of someone else on May 19 the two decided to sign an agreement that they will stop making comments about each other on Facebook.

Claassen signed it the next day. Until now Carvalho have not signed and meanwhile he again made comments about Claassen on Facebook.

Claassen said the slanderous comments on a Facebook page of a group with more than 7600 members. It is also open to all.",,status,,2015-06-03 06:31:38,0,0,0

1522943244635075_1583140678615331,"Open letter to Cde Zwelinzima Vavi 

                                 “By ye deeds, ye shall know them” Dialego 

Dear Nobhala of the working class I write this letter to you internally bleeding, time and again my heart bleeds when I see the material conditions faced by the black children of the working class at the University of the Witwatersrand and in the entire country. My understanding is that the hard conditions our parents face in the assembly line has now assimilated to us in our various spheres. Capitalists continue to make lives of poor black people and working class unpleasable; the black man is only subjected to hard labour, labour as Marx would argue has now become a new phenomenon of slavery for our parents, even young black graduates are coerced systematically to work conscientiously for the benefit of white monopoly capital. 

I know you probably asking yourself why I am raising issues through the lenses of colour, for you never declared yourself a Pan-Africanist or a nationalist for that matter. But I am raising this based on colour, because reality is that everything in our country revolves politics and race. Off course I also blame Colonialism of the Special type and separate developments for the plight faced by the black man today. I do not only end there, I also blame and condemn your distractors highly, because they are leading the working class into a wilderness, they have allowed factional politics to be their desire, while they neglect their Marxist-Leninist tools of analysis (I wonder if they ever applied them before). I believe that it does not take a Pan-Africanist to see that black people are struggling, the material conditions faced by many of us, dictate that we become conscious of the struggle of black students, black middle class, black working class and poor black people. 

Nobhala, a lot has been said about you, I have been one of those who have insulted you countlessly, I was a pioneer of smear campaigns that manifested themselves in labels such “Vavism”. I gained nothing from such campaigns, instead the masses continue to view you as one of the most leaders we have. They said you sold the old Cosatu House building, I keep asking myself how on earth can one individual sign all documents prescribed to sell and purchase a building. Were you a god, in the 9th floor, Nobhala? I do not think so.

 It is through smear campaigns that your distractors have diluted the revolution; they are making the progressive trade union federation cheerleaders of the African National Congress. If you critique the ANC, you are out! We saw this venomous, malice tendency with Julius Malema, Floyd Shivambu, NUMSA leadership; the SACP have labelled the leadership of NUMSA, as “NUMSA leadership clique” I will stick to NUMSA and we also saw this with your expulsion from COSATU. One must ask who is next? The expulsion of NUMSA still holds no revolutionary basis, it is based on emotions, how on earth can a trade union federation expel the exploited workers? They then continued to replace NUMSA with a trade union that has leadership but never went to an elective congress. I keep asking myself that, if NUMSA was counter-revolutionary why does it still have many members? The workers are not stupid, they would have called a special congress (as always) and replace the current leadership, many of them would have joined the new trade union. 

Right syndicalism is in its highest peak to destroy our trade unions and its federation. The rue of oligarchy has replaced democratic centralism; our great movements have been transformed to be like monarch-if you dare criticise leadership, we will deal with you. Karl Marx in Das Kapital (Vol 1) was indeed correct when he attested about the objectives of the capitalists, to keep the workplace in which the essential business going on is the exploitation of labor with ""No admittance except on business"", our revolutionary COSATU is slowly assimilating the ""hidden abode of production, on whose threshold there stares us in the face""-Don’t you dare criticize the ANC! This leads to what I have termed as “double exploitation” it means the workers are exploited by capitalists and also by trade union leaders who have a tendency of putting their hands in empty pockets of workers and take their last penny. 

Nobhala, what pains me most, is that COSATU was nowhere to be seen when children of the working class and the poor were rejected by NSFAS at Wits and Tshwane University of Technology. Students were told there is no money, but the Minister of Finance, Nhlanhla Nene had awarded close to R26 Billion to Eskom, I do not know how this money assisted, because even today black townships still suffer a lot from load-shedding. I reside in a student residence close to Haughton; I do not recall any day were we suffered from load shedding! Even when the Wits SRC led by Cde Mcebo Dlamini fundraised for us, I did not hear of any cent coming from COSATU coffers. Nobhala, at Wits lectures halls during the day they are centers of teaching and learning but at night they become bedroom to students who did not receive funding for accommodation, most of them feed on dustbins at night in order to survive hunger. Poverty is painful, young black people are angry, angry people are dangerous. I keep asking myself where is the Vanguard Party and COSATU to assist my fellow students who are struggling. 

There is a lot I wanted to address in this letter, but my conclusion is simple, you started burning the flame of our revolution, you made it clear that we must not mourn but mobilize, in that spirit, I would like to urge you not to forget that the struggle of a black child still continues. As you throughout the whole country, many of us support you, talk to our parents, engage them, and remind them that the struggle is bigger than us. That our enemy is one; it is none other than, white supremacy that has been enhanced by white monopoly capital.

ANC calls for JP’s head
 
The New Age
Vincent Cruywagen
Thursday, 30 April 2015
 
‘THE ANC will today call for mayoral member for safety and security, JP Smith to be dismissed amid allegations that gang members were hired as security guards on city development project sites.   
 
The ANC has planned to move a motion in today’s council meeting to get Smith censured and dismissed.
 
Leader of the opposition in the City of Cape Town Council, Tony Ehrenreich, said they would send a letter to the national police ministry asking for a comprehensive investigation into the links between the city mayor and organised crime in Cape Town.
 
The scandal relates to allegations that members of the notorious Hard Livings gang were employed as security guards by a company responsible for renovating flats in Manenberg.
 
It is also alleged the gang demanded protection money and threatened to derail the project if they were axed.    
 
The situation reached a boiling point in December when members of the Americans gang became aware. Skirmishes then apparently took place.
 
Earlier this month the mayoral committee member for human settlements Benedicta van Minnen confirmed an investigation was under way and action be taken once the outcome of the investigation had been confirmed.
 
 Ehrenreich said: “We will today propose a motion and dismissal of JP Smith. It is clear that Smith has been involved in this saga from an early stage and only sent the letter after legal advice for him to find a way to be exempt from inclusion in the events.
 
There is documented proof that the City had been aware of the fact that gang members were involved in the security arrangements. This clearly point out the City’s links to organised crime – a fact the mayor was made aware of’.",,status,,2015-04-30 07:40:20,0,0,0

""an unreasonable fear or hatred of foreigners or strangers or of that which is foreign or strange.""...and it is made up of the word ""xeno"" meaning strange or foreign and ""phobia"" meaning fear.. With this in mind how can the goings-on of recent weeks be defined a xenophobia?  South Africans are not afraid of the strangers or foreigners, they are carrying out acts of crime against them . As usual the govenrnment and the media have latched on to a convenient catch phrase and sugar coat the activities by chalking them up to xenophobia. Africa as a whole, and South Africa in particular,  has a history of tribal wars, faction fighting and crime.  That is what we are experiencing in South Africa...Tribal wars , faction fighting, and acts of crime. Just at the moment,  the soft target are foreigners. Lets stop using the silly word zenophobia and call it what it is CRIME, ASSAULT, MURDER, LOOTING, ROBBERY,THEFT, BATTERY, RAPE, BURGLARY etc.",,status,,2015-04-30 01:57:39,0,0,0

Most of this guys entered illegally into the country via Swaziland, Mozambique and Lesotho borders due to corrupt officials and lax border security. That is not even a main issue, you must remember majority of this immigrants are from a war torn countries and are highly skilled rebels posing an extensive threat to our security in the country. Can you imagine how many of them have obtained weapon by illicit means, what will happen when they decide to go rampage?? 
With the current situation in Durban some has gone as far as issuing threats that we haven't seen anything as yet.......
i'm perplexed by lack of response, do we have surveillance around this most Nigerians, Somalians, Bangladeshis, Pakistanis that are in the country??
Do we realize that this can escalate to a civil unrest and become a fertile ground for terrorism

Our task is bigger than all of us as individuals as we are about building a South Africa that is Non Racial, Non Sexist and Prosperous. As part of a Progressive Movement in Afrika and World Wide, we have a mission of building a better world. Since the 1994 democratic breakthrough, what we need to understand is that, Apartheid Colonialism legacy remains with us in all manner of ways. Our Movement was born informed of a need to Unite in order to achieve all what we want to achieve. The old expression remains relevant as was in 1912 that United we Stand and Divided we Fall. When we are united, we have NOTHING to lose, BUT everything to gain. 

A call to ALL those that carried us in difficult times, in the 1950's, 1960's, 1970's and 1980's must be made, firstly, to say SORRY for having forgotten about you - the shopkeepers who would earn as little as R500.00 a day, our Poets, our progressive teachers, our Priests, our Women folk, our Media activists, our Doctors and Nurses, our Traditional Doctors, our Non Racial Sports People etc. 

To all those that got disgruntled for whatever reasons and left our Glorious Movement led by the ANC, the time to come back home is now.

Remember, Leaders come, Leaders go, BUT your ANC, MY ANC REMAINS, with a simple agenda of bettering the lives of our ordinary People and building a Non Racial, Non Sexist and Prosperous SA.

1522943244635075_1559608370968562,"Hi my name is John Lourens 0812677593 johnlourens5274@gmail.com
I live on a small farm Pretoria East Tierpoot and I have been in an on going battle with Eskom over my close to 100 indigenous trees!

My trees ly on a servitude part of the farm and they are home to game and birds ! Bush baby's, hornbills ,bush buck and wild cats ! Hedgehogs and various other natural occurring fauna!

I have left the area in peace protecting it from poaching and interferences !
Some trees are over 80 to ninety years old and magnificent some on the protection list ! 
In the past due to the up keep and maintenance of the line I have allowed that the trees be trimmed to with in the legal clearance ! With no problems and they get done every year !

Now over the last year I have been involved in the battle as they have instructed me that the trees are illegal and that the whole lot need to be removed ! Which is strange as the trees have been there longer than the existences of Eskom has !
I have had many a meeting where I have been bullied by numerous different officials !
The Last couple of days have been hell I got an email on the Thursday of this last week at 16 .13 that they offer me 5 transplant trees to the values of not exceeding R 50 000.00 rand !
But that I had till close of business that day to give my answers or they where going to the high court to obtain a court order against me with cost against me ! I replied that I could not respond in such short time as I needed to seek council ! They tried Friday again and I told them Monday coming !

In the months prior they got me to as I asked to have the trees moved !! Get a specialist in in the job of moving trees to give a quote and evaluation! 
Which I did and sent on the quote !
They then asked me to ascertain the value of the trees ! Which I did and forwarded !
I would like to state I made it clear in all meetings and correspondence that I am not at all interested in compensation for the trees but want them trimmed as in past years or moved !

Saturday yesterday I got a summons that asks the court to make urgent application to gain access to my property to remove all my trees and that the Saps a company them and use reasonable force against me ! Oh and I pay all there costs !! 1!!
I have to give notice by 13h 00 on monday the 16 March of my intention to defend and go to court Tuesday !
I have no representation and it's only me !
I need to do this for my trees and the animals that make it there home !

Please help me! 
Please like and share to every one!
And every organisations that can help !

1522943244635075_1555882061341193,"IFP: CALLS FOR RE-TRAINING OF ALL FRONTLINE STAFF AT HEALTH FACILITIES

The IFP in KwaZulu-Natal calls on the MEC of Health, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo to make it mandatory that all frontline staff be retrained on proper customer care after reports that patients are being turned away at some healthcare facilities.

""Nandi Clinic in Stanger is one example of such a healthcare facility where patients are being turned away by nurses and of nurses treating patients with little or no respect. I conducted an unannounced oversight visit to this clinic where the patients told me that nurses are not treating them well. My oversight
 visit came after I received serious complaints from concerned community members about bad treatment they received at Nandi Clinic. This is unacceptable and calls for immediate intervention by the MEC,"" said IFP Spokesperson on Health, Mrs Ncamisile Nkwanyana, MPL.

""The right of all citizens to receive quality treatment in public healthcare facilities is specifically guaranteed by our constitution. No one deserves to be treated in an inhumane manner especially by medical personnel who took an oath to serve those who are ill. People go to these public health care facilities because they are in need of medical help from people who are paid from tax payer's money. Nurses with bad attitudes towards patients must be removed from the health profession as their conduct is unacceptable,"" continued Mrs Nkwanyana.

""Government cannot hope to achieve its goals in terms of the National Health Insurance while such conditions prevail at our public health care facilities. The MEC, HOD and other senior managers are urged to conduct unannounced visits without any fanfare to get a clear picture of what goes on and not be fooled by
 the airbrushed reports that they get from some facilities when they visit with delegations,"" concluded Mrs Nkwanyana.

The IFP demands that the MEC must develop a roadmap, which provides a strategic long-term framework for government in terms of human resource development, health facility upgrading and the establishment of specialised services and institutions.

RESPONSE TO THE 2015 KWAZULU-NATAL STATE OF THE PROVINCE ADDRESS BY: HONOURABLE BLESSED GWALA MPL

TUESDAY, 03 MARCH 2015
 Venue: KZN Legislature

Thanks Premier for the State of the Province address:

Hon Speaker, I want to commence by reminding the Hon Premier of what he said when he took office in May 2014, he said:

""I want to assure the Judge, President and the people of KwaZulu-Natal in general that as elected representatives of the aspirations of millions of our people, we will cast our eyes into the future with a clear understanding that failure is not an option""

Today I rise to say to the Hon Premier that you and your executive have closed your eyes and failed the millions of our people in KwaZulu-Natal.

Hon Speaker, the Inkatha Freedom Party was expecting the Hon Premier to set the mind of His Majesty at ease regarding the Royal Household Trust and its sustainability. The Premier should have informed this House as to why his government took a decision to disestablish the Department of the Royal Household without consultation with other political parties. When the future of this
 Department was discussed, it was agreed that the Department will be disbanded only after all political parties are satisfied that the Royal Household Trust will be able to sustain itself and manage its affairs in the interest of His Majesty and the Royal family. Since His Majesty was present at SOPA, it would have been appropriate for the Hon Premier to explain why this decision was taken in such a clandestine manner. In this regard the Premier has failed His Majesty and the Royal Family.

I would like to remind the Hon Premier that in his address in this House last year, His Majesty instructed MEC Xaba to fast track the programme ""ukubiywa kwamasimu"" but this programme has not even started in Ngwavuma and Nongoma. Here again you have failed, Hon Premier.

It is good that the Hon Premier mentioned his concerns around increasing criminal activity in the province. Here again the Premier has failed the law abiding citizens of KZN. Hon Speaker, how can this Premier expect to curb crime and ensure the safety of our citizens when the Provincial Commissioner, Mmamonnye Ngobeni has a dark cloud hanging over her head. For a long time the
 IFP has raised its concern about the credibility and suitability of Ngobeni to head crime fighting in KZN. I must commend the Independent Police Investigation Directorate (IPID) for its report and now the police are carrying out investigations under Section

12 which deals with serious misconduct against the Commissioner, a Colonel and a Captain all on related charges of corruption. We want to see that an advocate with a clean track record be at the head of the disciplinary hearings. How can
 police personnel feel inspired and be motivated when their provincial commissioner is under investigation? How can the KZN community feel safe when the police has such dubious personnel sitting in high offices? But even though we advised the Premier not to renew her contract when it expired last year while these allegations were hanging over her head, her contract was renewed on recommendation from this executive to the National Police Commissioner. Is the Hon Premier serious about reducing crime? Just this past week a 71 year old couple, Susanna and Melvin Lawson were murdered at Oribi Village just up the road from where we are, Hluhluwe farmer, Terrence Rizzato was gunned down, a well-known Estcourt farmer Malcolm 'Stick' Green was also killed and the list goes on to include rapes, burglaries, hijackings and robberies. In this regard the Premier has failed every law abiding citizen in KZN. The IFP sends its condolences to all those who have lost loved ones due to the broken promises of
 this Executive.

Hon Speaker, this Executive closed their eyes and failed the thousands of learners across our province. Let me remind the Premier that speaking about education during his Inauguration in May 2014 he said: ""We want to ensure an improvement in our matric results from the previous term of office""

But what did the Premier do - he appointed a MEC that stumbles from one disaster to another. How can we consider the drop in the matric pass rate from 77.4% in 2013 to 69.7% last year ""an improvement""? It is a disaster! How can we consider the ""mass copying"" uncovered by Umalusi ""an improvement""? It is a disaster and a disgrace! Unfortunately this MEC will consider it ""a good story to tell"" while our children's lives are being destroyed. Here again you have failed our people.

The Premier mentioned that far too many of our school children are being killed or injured while being transported in bakkies but he does not provide a solution to the challenge of scholar transport. How many of our children must still die before this government will apply its mind and come up with a workable solution? Again the Premier has failed.

Let me also remind the Premier what he said about health care:
 ""During this term of office we will move with speed towards the introduction of the National Health Insurance system. There is no turning back""

How can you turn back when you are lying flat on your face with no sense of direction? The implementation of the NHI seems a distant dream while conditions at our public health care facilities deteriorate. When my colleague in the IFP, the Hon Nkwanyana goes on oversight visits to hospitals to see how she can assist, not only patients but also staff, the MEC for Health gets hot under the
 collar and wants to complain to the Speaker. Complain about what? This Hon Member is doing what every Hon Member in this House should be doing and that is to conduct oversight and inform the MEC about any shortcomings. Is MEC Dhlomo ashamed of what is going on at some hospitals that he wants to prevent MPLs from doing their jobs?

Madame Speaker, allow me to remind Hon Members what the Hon Premier said at SOPA last week:

""We acknowledge and respect the oversight role of this House as set out in the Constitution""

Whilst the Hon Premier acknowledges and encourages MPLs to perform oversight, the MEC for Health is against this.

Our public hospital infrastructure is crumbling, there is a shortage of doctors and nurses are resigning in droves afraid that they will not get their pension fund money when they retire. There is a shortage of medicines even at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Memorial Hospital which is supposed to be the flagship health care facility of our province and a model for the country so much so that the
 NGO, the Gift of the Givers had to come to the rescue of the Department of Health by donating the required medicines. I take this opportunity to thank the Gift of the Givers for its humanitarian work nationally and internationally. Here again, Hon Premier your Cabinet is failing our people.

Speaking at the Provincial Lekgotla two weeks ago the Hon Premier said: ""There is corruption in government. I no longer doubt that particular issue."" It is wonderful that there was that admission but the Premier in his address did not convince the people of this province that he has a strategy on how to tackle the corruption that exists across all spheres of government. Whilst you identified supply chain management as an area where corruption exists, you must admit that there are many other areas of government where corruption is rife. By not outlining a clear, workable strategy, Hon Premier you are failing our people.

Allow me to remind the Premier that President Zuma had called for an investigation into the abuse of tax payers' money on projects like the International North Sea Jazz Festival, Commemorating Prisoners of War - St Helena event and the KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board. Millions of Rands were paid to the organisers but the project never took place and money was not recovered that
 saw this province losing millions of rand. I was expecting the Premier to heed this call and report on the outcome of the investigation in the SOPA. But here again you have failed not only this House but President Zuma himself.

I will give credit where it is due and therefore I must commend the
 identification of teachers who have been using fraudulent certificates to gain promotions and increased salaries. These people must be charged and if found guilty they must be dismissed and blacklisted from working in any government
 department. The investigations must be ongoing and must be intensified to root out fraud and corruption even among officials in all departments.

Hon Speaker, I would have expected the Premier to say something about the recent reports that KZN spent more than R5billion on consultants

- the highest in the country. The Department of Health itself spent R1.8billion on consultants. As the IFP we are convinced that such excessive use of consultants can only be attributed to the ANC's policy of cadre deployment that sees unqualified, inexperienced and incompetent card-carrying members being deployed into positions that they are not fit to occupy. If the Hon Premier is
 serious about rooting out corruption, he has to pronounce on this issue because such deployments are also examples of corrupt practices.

We are aware of the turmoil that exists at Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife and the unhappiness among the staff. The HOD has been suspended but no charges have been preferred against him. This entity plays such a vital role in conservation and is recognised internationally, but the Premier failed to mention anything about
 this. Could it be that this government wants to shut down this entity or have it taken over by National Parks?

The Premier has failed to inform this House why the proposed Drakensberg Cable Way is set to go ahead even though the Environment Impact Assessment has not been completed and the local community has not been taken on board. Could it be
 that someone has been paid off already to ensure that the project goes ahead?

The same question could be asked with regard to the proposed Dug Out Port south of Durban. Even though international experts advise that more use should be made of the existing Durban harbour there is talk to continue with this ambitious and
 ill-advised project.

The Premier also failed to mention the much talked about Business Train between Durban and Pietermaritzburg. Why is this service not up and running after millions of rand has been invested in this project?

The Premier rightfully paid tribute to the late Senzo Meyiwa but seems to have forgotten his pledge of naming a stadium or sports academy in memory of our football hero. Was that commitment just another nice thing to say at the time with no intention of fulfilling it? Whilst on this issue I must raise our concern about the huge expenditure incurred during state funerals where service
 providers and even some officials end up fleecing government. This is something that the Premier must seriously consider going forward.

In reference to the economy and job creation, the Hon Premier said: ""We are experiencing a situation where the private sector seems reluctant to invest in the local economy""

It is encouraging that the Premier acknowledges this challenge. I would advise the Cabinet to take heed of the comments and suggestions made by the private sector at the Executive Retreat held in November last year.

It is also good to note that many times during the SOPA the Premier referred to the erratic power supply as a ""crisis"" but unfortunately the President of the country who is also President of the ANC has said that it is not a crisis. With this kind of confused leadership, it is no wonder that investor confidence is dwindling.

But on a more positive note it is encouraging to note that the Samsung Manufacturing Plant and the Keystone Light Industrial and Logistics Park are on track as these initiatives will go a long way to create sustainable jobs.

Hon Speaker, in his address the Hon Premier acknowledged many serious challenges that face us as a province and I thank him for his honesty in this regard, but he fell short of convincing our citizens that he has strategies in place to address these challenges. Let me mention some of them

1. With regard to people living below the poverty line of R318 per month, this government had set itself a target to reduce the number to 18%, but in fact the number rose from 25% to 28%. Here again the Premier failed to say how this government intends to turn this around.

2. Regarding social inequality, this government had a target of 19.4% but it has remained at 17.6% between 2010 and 2014. Here again the Premier has failed.

3. The Hon Premier reported: ""a woman is killed every 6 hours by her partner"". This is a tragic but factual revelation but there was no assurance coming from the SOPA that our women will be safe going forward. Here again the Premier has failed.

4. Weaknesses in local government management are leading to numerous, often violent and destructive, service delivery protests, but SOPA provided no strategy to strengthen local government management. Again the Premier has failed.

5. For many years now we have been hearing of more international airlines landing at King Shaka International Airport but apart from Emirates no other international carrier has come forward but SOPA has not provided an explanation or any progress. Here again the Premier has failed.

1522943244635075_1539851152944284,"IFP: MEC MUST TAKE ACTION AGAINST IMBAMBAZANE MAYOR

The IFP in KwaZulu-Natal calls on the MEC of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Nomusa Dube-Ncube to urgently take action against the Imbabazane Mayor, Phindile Strydom whose car was yet again involved in an accident.

""On Friday the mayor's driver, driving a white Toyota Fortuner smashed into a stationary Chevrolet in the parking lot. The mayor was in the Toyota dressed in her ANC attire when the accident occurred. After both the mayor and her driver checked the damage, the mayor instructed her driver to leave the scene without
 reporting the matter to the police. Assisted by community members, traffic officers were able to trace the mayor and her driver. This a blatant disregard of the law and must be viewed as a criminal offence,"" said IFP Leader in the KZN Legislature, Mr Blessed Gwala, MPL.

""The owner of the damaged car contacted the mayor and her driver at the Imbabazane offices and they requested that the matter should be settled out of court. This new Fortuner is being used by the mayor after her previous vehicle which cost the municipality about R3million was written off when she was not in the vehicle near Mooi River. It would appear that the mayor and her body guards have taken a conscious decision to destroy council vehicles and show a total
 disregard for the rule of law. In failing to act decisively against the mayor, the MEC is failing the people of Imbabazane,"" continued Mr Gwala.

""We want to see the MEC taking action against the mayor and her bodyguards. We are aware that if it was an IFP mayor, the ANC in Imbabazane, MEC and the ANC provincial leadership would have been very vocal in calling for the removal of the mayor, but because it's an ANC mayor they are turning a blind eye. We demand that the MEC shows leadership and acts in this matter,"" concluded Mr Gwala.

The IFP calls for the urgent removal of Imbabazane Mayor, Phindile Strydom along with her driver and bodyguards.
